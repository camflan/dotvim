WHAT?
=====

This is my primary, day-to-day, .vim and .vimrc. It's tuned for macvim.
I do not publish any of my other .vimrc or .vim which I use for windows gvim
or *nix terminals.

feel free to use all or part of my vimrc to learn, modify, use. If used in
a .vimrc you intend to distribute, please credit appropriately.
